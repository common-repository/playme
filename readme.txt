Embeddable Song Request Form for Radio Stations

== Description ==

Embeddable Song Request Form for Radio Stations

**Designed for Radio Stations**

PlayMe was requested by a radio station deejay and built to best serve both the studio and the listeners.

* Listeners may provide their name, the artist/song name, and a dedication (or comments), to make realtime requests to Radio Stations and Deejays.
* The form is easily embeddable using the shortcode **[playme]** and can optionally require Google's reCAPTCHA to verify requests before they're submitted. Put "[playme]" on its own line in the page content (using Text View) to position the PlayMe form where you want it to appear on your page.
* On the backend, requests are shown in a list that refreshes passively every minute, and can be dismissed/hidden once the request has been addressed.
* For privacy, the only information captured (apart from what's entered in the submission form) is an IP Address, to offer some insight to site owners about those who are submitting song requests. 

**3rd Party Services**

Be advised about the 3rd Party services used by this plugin.

* **Google reCAPTCHA**: Optionally, site owners may configure PlayMe to use [Google's reCAPTCHA](https://support.google.com/recaptcha/answer/6080904?hl=en "What is Google&apos;s reCAPTCHA?") service to help minimize abuse of the Song Request form. More information about this service can be found on Google's [privacy policy](https://policies.google.com/privacy?hl=en "Google Privacy Policy") and [terms of service](https://policies.google.com/terms?hl=en "Google Terms of Service") of use. 
* **WhatIsMyIPAddress.com**: PlayMe offers a link for site owners to quickly discover/review the geographic location on record associated with the IP address of the submitter of the Song Request (IP-to-Location). This service is provided by a 3rd Party. More information about [WhatIsMyIPAddress.com](https://whatismyipaddress.com "The WhatIsMyIPAddress Website") can be found on its [website](https://whatismyipaddress.com "The WhatIsMyIPAddress Website"), its [privacy policy](https://whatismyipaddress.com/privacy-policy "The WhatIsMyIPAddress Privacy Policy"), and its [terms of use](https://whatismyipaddress.com/terms-of-use "The WhatIsMyIPAddress Terms of Use").
